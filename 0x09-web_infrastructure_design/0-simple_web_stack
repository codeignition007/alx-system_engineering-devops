*What is a server?
Servers are physical machines (as hardwares), virtual machines or softwares (computer programs) that serve or provide functionality to other programs or devices called “clients”. The term server comes from queuing theory used in Kendall’s notation, where servers serve or process the clients requirements in the same way as a telephone operator, a cooker or a production machine process incoming orders, having in mind its capacity and service process time.

A computer can function as a server, and a server can be a computer, both of them being built up with hardware and software. However, the main difference between these two is the capacity and computer power servers have. In other words, servers are computers on steroids with faster processing capacity. They are usually stored in data centers racks (stacks of servers piled one on top of each other).

On the other hand, virtual servers function more like virtual machines, or virtual computers. These are a virtual representation of the physical servers, having their own operating system and applications (Posey, 2021).

*What is the role of the domain name?
The role of the domain name is to replace complex IP address numbers into easily understandable names so humans can remember and communicate them in a better way.

*What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
DNS record of www belongs to a subdomain of the www.foobar.com

*What is the role of the web server?
The main function of a Web server is to store the files of a site and broadcast them over the Internet so that they can be visited by users. Basically, a web server is a large computer that stores and transmits data via the network system called the Internet. 

*What is the role of the application server?
The application server is the intermediary between browser-based databases and back-end databases and legacy systems. In many uses, the application server combines or works with a web server (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and is called a web application server.

*What is the role of the database?
The role of the database is to make the information gathered organized so it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

*What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
The server is using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which enables the transfer of resource and data, such as HTML documents between the server and the user.

*Explain what the issues are with this infrastructure

*SPOF
One of the issues of having a simple web infrastructure, has to do with the SPOF (Single Point of Failure) where if component of the system fails, there is no backup that can support the continuity of the functionality of the system, bringing the whole system to a collapse by being unable to operate.

*Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Whenever some structure or node in the system needs to be repaired, the whole system has to be shut down, while the maintenance is done. Then, client requests cannot be attended during this period of time.

*Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
Overload of traffic can be a risk to the server capacity. This, because there is no possibility to scale the service with additional servers as backup. Leading to a possible breakdown of the web page and client requests, as traffic surpasess servers capacity.
